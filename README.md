# gtb

gtb is short for "graphics test bench" This is an excuse to write a "simple" Vulkan-based rendering application. The objective is to feel out Vulkan usage in a way that facilitates building a next generation application with appropriate abstractions.

The project is not ready to be archived, I still may want to come back and play with Vulkan more, but I have what I need out of it for now.

Prereq
------
Vulkan SDK install.

How to Build
------------
1. Clone the repo (remember the --recurse-submodule flag.)
2. Build modules. (Follow steps in modules\module_build_steps.txt)
3. Build the app.

How to Run
----------
gtb.exe <gltf file name>
